# Soil
A (very WIP) lightweight ASCII game development framework.

## Features
- Classes to aid in creating and drawing ASCII graphics.
- Interchangeable rendering backends/outputs (currently only Windows Command Prompt (cmd) is implemented).
- Wrapper for FMOD Studio to help with audio data organization.
